## Prolog

This really powerful annotation-based API library is build on top of the PSR-7 standard. It reuses immutable `Request` & `Response` objects. It's well known that [Presenters](https://api.nette.org/2.4/Nette.Application.UI.Presenter.html) are the `alpha` and the `omega` in Nette applications. The presenters are not very suitable for API requests.

We have taken an idea from Java ([Spring Framework](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)) and many others and together we have created a Controller-based API. With full annotation support.

Controllers are small objects which can be registered in DIC as services (same as [Presenters](https://api.nette.org/2.4/Nette.Application.UI.Presenter.html)). They have a few public annotated methods. If one of the methods is matched by a router, it is called with `ApiRequest` and `ApiResponse` passed objects.

That's all. Take a look, it's really simple.

```php
namespace App\Controllers;

use Contributte\Api\Annotation\Controller\Controller;
use Contributte\Api\Annotation\Controller\Method;
use Contributte\Api\Annotation\Controller\Path;
use Contributte\Api\Annotation\Controller\RootPath;
use Contributte\Api\Http\ApiRequest;
use Contributte\Api\Http\ApiResponse;
use Contributte\Api\UI\Controller\IController;

/**
 * @Controller
 * @RootPath("/hello")
 */
final class HelloController implements IController
{

    /**
     * @Path("/world")
     * @Method("GET")
     * @param ApiRequest $request
     * @param ApiResponse $response
     * @return ApiResponse
     */
    public function index(ApiRequest $request, ApiResponse $response)
    {
        return $response->writeBody('Hello world!');
    }
}
```

And register your controller as service.

```yaml
services:
    - App\Controllers\HelloController
```

As you can see, the architecture is ultra simple. `ApiRequest` & `ApiResponse` extend PSR-7, so you can re-use these declared methods.
